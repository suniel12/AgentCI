"""
Golden Trace Diff Engine.

Compares a "current" trace against a "golden" (known-good) trace
and produces categorized diffs. The key insight: don't just say
"traces differ." Say exactly WHAT differs and WHY it matters.

Phase 1: Exact matching on tool names and arguments.
Phase 2: Add semantic matching via LLM-as-Judge for fuzzy comparison.
